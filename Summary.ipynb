    "Nowadays, the  physical health has become a serious concern in the modern society since excess storage of fat will lead to a variety range of disease and highly leave up the risk of coronary heart disease. To measure the fat of person, we also have developed several methods, including BMI index, which is the quotient of weight divided by height squared. \n",

    "## 1.1 Outliers Detection\n",
    "The data we have is BodyFat.csv file which includes **253** persons physical data in total **17** variables. In order to use these data to build the model, we use three different types of methods to detect not only the outliers, but also the influence points in the original dataset, \n",

However, the if the imputed data does not reasonable neither, we have to delete it from the dataset. For the high influence point, we prefer to delete those points."

    "In this part, several methods have been applied, including stepwise aic and bic selection, lasso, mallowâ€™s cp and Bess, which is a new proposed way to selecting variables. After applying these methods, since the total sample size is not large, we can use cross validation to measure the performance of each method, to decide which component should be treated as the independent variable in the final model. To be specific, the final model should be as a rule of thumb, which requires that the quantity of the independent variables should not exceed four."

    "# 4 Conclusion\n",
    "#### Advantage: \n",
    "**1.Rule of Thumb:** The model we use only include two variables, which it is easy for test person to acquire its bodyfat percentage quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Simplicity:** The model only uses around 250 data to build a linear model, which is easy to handle for a modern computer.\n",
    "#### Disadvantage:\n",
    "**1.Not a well-founded model** This model is founded by about 250 person, which can hardly represent all of human since there might be some differences among different district.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Measurement error:** Since the abdomen has been included in the model, it is easily to be measured incorrectly for normal people."
